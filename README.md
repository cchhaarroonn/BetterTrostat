# BetterTrostat
Same as Cryp70m4n Trostat project just made in Golang
Check out original Trostat that is made in python but that is bit gay: https://github.com/Cryp70m4n/trostat

## Installation

Git clone this repo and you will be ready to run BetterTrostat

## Usage

Just run the main.go with go run main.go command or build and run the project

## Note

Doesn't really do much and is useless if you dont apply to get developer client_id which is MUST HAVE to run this lmao
